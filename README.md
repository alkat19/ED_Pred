## 🔮 Interactive Risk Calculator

**Try the online risk calculator:** [https://alkat19.github.io/ED_Pred/](https://alkat19.github.io/ED_Pred/)

This interactive tool implements a simplified logistic regression model using the top 10 predictors from our study, allowing users to estimate eating disorder risk based on factors measured around age 11.
